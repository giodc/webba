# Fixes Applied - October 4, 2025

## Issue 1: Dashboard Not Loading
**Problem**: Dashboard was not running due to PHP warning in authentication system.

**Root Cause**: Line 58 in `/opt/webbadeploy/gui/includes/auth.php` was accessing `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` without checking if it exists, causing a PHP warning that prevented headers from being sent.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added null coalescing operator (`??`) to provide fallback value of `'/'`
- Changed: `$_SESSION['redirect_after_login'] = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];`
- To: `$_SESSION['redirect_after_login'] = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] ?? '/';`

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - Dashboard now loads correctly and redirects to login page as expected.

## Issue 2: Let's Encrypt Email Update Permission Denied
**Problem**: When trying to save Let's Encrypt email in settings, got error: `sed: couldn't open temporary file /opt/webbadeploy/sed6KJPWD: Permission denied`

**Root Cause**: The `sed -i` command was trying to create temporary files in `/opt/webbadeploy/` directory, which the container didn't have write permissions for. The directory is owned by `giodc:giodc` with `755` permissions.

**Fixes Applied**:

1. **Primary Fix - Replaced sed with PHP file operations** (`/opt/webbadeploy/gui/settings.php`):
   - Changed from using `sed -i` command to native PHP `file_get_contents()` and `file_put_contents()`
   - Uses `preg_replace()` to update the email in memory
   - No longer requires write permissions to the directory, only to the file itself
   - More reliable and portable solution

2. **File Permissions** (for current installation):
   ```bash
   sudo chown www-data:www-data /opt/webbadeploy/docker-compose.yml
   sudo chmod 664 /opt/webbadeploy/docker-compose.yml
   ```

3. **Updated `/opt/webbadeploy/fix-docker-permissions.sh`**:
   - Added docker-compose.yml permission fix to the script
   - Now sets proper ownership and permissions automatically

4. **Updated `/opt/webbadeploy/install-production.sh`**:
   - Added docker-compose.yml permission configuration during installation
   - Ensures new installations have correct permissions from the start

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - Web GUI can now update Let's Encrypt email successfully without directory write permissions.

## Testing Performed

1. **Dashboard Access**: ✅ Confirmed dashboard loads and redirects to login properly
2. **Login Page**: ✅ Verified login page renders without errors
3. **File Read Permissions**: ✅ Tested web container can read docker-compose.yml
4. **File Write Permissions**: ✅ Tested web container can write to docker-compose.yml
5. **PHP File Operations**: ✅ Verified file_get_contents() and file_put_contents() work correctly

## Files Modified

1. `/opt/webbadeploy/gui/includes/auth.php` - Fixed REQUEST_URI access
2. `/opt/webbadeploy/gui/settings.php` - Replaced sed with PHP file operations
3. `/opt/webbadeploy/fix-docker-permissions.sh` - Added docker-compose.yml permissions
4. `/opt/webbadeploy/install-production.sh` - Added docker-compose.yml permissions to install process
5. `/opt/webbadeploy/docker-compose.yml` - Updated ownership and permissions

## Ready for Cloud Deployment

Both critical issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Dashboard is stable and functional
- ✅ Settings can be updated without permission errors
- ✅ Install script updated for future deployments
- ✅ Permission fix script available for existing installations

The system is now safe to deploy to production cloud environments.
